Description: Apply tests of multiple comparisons based
    on studentized 'midrange' and 'range' distributions. 
    The tests are: Tukey Midrange ('TM' test),
    Student-Newman-Keuls Midrange ('SNKM' test), 
    Means Grouping Midrange ('MGM' test) and 
    Means Grouping Range ('MGR' test). The articles of these 
    tests are in the submission phase, and we will soon update the references.
